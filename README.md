# Analyzing-Wikipedia-Talk-Network-with-GraphX

This project focuses on using Apache Spark’s
GraphX module to identify communities in the Wikipedia Talk
Network. To identify distinctive communities within this enormous social network dataset, we use the Connected Components
algorithm. We address scalability issues by utilizing Spark’s
capabilities for distributed computing. For the purpose of meaningful community discovery, our work entails data preprocessing,
graph construction, and algorithm execution. We investigate
optimization techniques that guarantee both performance and
accuracy. The project’s results improve our comprehension of
social dynamics in the Wikipedia Talk Network and show how
useful GraphX and Spark are for performing graph-based
analytics. These revelations have larger applications in anomaly
detection, recommendation systems, and social network analysis.
The interconnectedness of participants and their communities is
revealed, demonstrating the power of distributed graph processing.
